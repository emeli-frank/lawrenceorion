    <h2>Our History</h2>

    <p>Evidence Based Health Care Research Group (EBHC) was informed and supported by Alexander von Humboldt 
        Foundation return fellowship awarded to the group coordinator. Staff and post graduate students of 
        Nnamdi Azikiwe University interested in the group's research themes were invited to join the group. 
        The first inaugural meeting held in the Faculty of Pharmacy, Nnamdi Azikiwe University on the 16th of 
        January, 2017.</p>

    <p>EBHC conducts research principally in the following three major areas: Systematic Reviews; 
        Clinical Research; and Pharmacoeconomics.</p>

    <h2>Systematic Reviews</h2>

    <p>A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility 
    criteria in order to answer a specific research question.  It  uses explicit, systematic methods that 
    are selected with a view to minimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings from which conclusions 
    can be drawn and decisions made.</p>

    <p>The key characteristics of a systematic review are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria for studies</li>
        <li>An explicit, reproducible methodology</li>
        <li>A systematic search that attempts to identify all studies that would meet the eligibility criteria</li>
        <li>An assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies</li>
        <li>A systematic presentation, and synthesis, of the characteristics and findings of the included studies</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Meta-analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize the results of independent studies. 
    Many systematic reviews contain meta-analyses. By combining information from all relevant studies, 
    meta-analyses can provide more precise estimates of the effects of health care than those derived 
    from the individual studies included within a review. They also facilitate investigations of the 
    consistency of evidence across studies, and the exploration of differences across studies.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Research</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mechanisms of human disease</li>
        <li>Therapeutic interventions</li>
        <li>Clinical trials</li>
        <li>Development of new technologies</li>
        <li>Epidemiologic and behavioral studies</li>
        <li>Outcomes research and health services research</li>
    </ol>
